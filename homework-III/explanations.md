## Variables

Variables are like buckets or placeholders or containers where you can put something, that things you put inside variables are called values for example: you have a variable called name, you can put any name inside and it will look like this:
```javascript
    var name = "Memunat Manzuma";
```
 you write 'var' first to tell the system you want to work with variable and 'name' is the placeholder you create to hold the value 'Memunat Manzuma'.

## Strings
Strings are use to save text, do changes to the text and you put it inside quotes. for example 
```javascript
    const car = 'Benz';
    const num = 674;
```

## Functions
 Function is a set of code you write to perform a particular task.for example you build a website and all your pages must carry the same header and footer, what you will just do is to create a function that holds one header and one footer, when you will now call it on the web pages you need them.

## `if` statements
If statements are conditional words like for example you go to school Monday to Firday and you must wake up 5 0'clock to meetup, so you set an alerm to wake you by 5 0'clock and when it is not yet 5 0'clock the alarm will not ring... 
```javascript
if (time == 5) {
    wake = "Wake Up, is Time";
}
```

you can have many conditional words by using if else, for example you have not finish your homework 
```javascript
if (homework = finish) {
    work = "Completed";
} else {
    work = "Not Completed";
}
``` 
you can also have somthing like this
```javascript
if (Good) {
    work = "Your Work is Good";
} else if (Bad) {
    work = "Your Work is Bad";
} else {
    work = "I Dont Know either Your Work is Good or Bad";
}
```
This is called Nested If, when you have If inside If

## Boolean values 
Boolean values is not like if statements that can hold many condition, Boolean only need a data type that can only have one of two values like YES or NO, TRUE or FALSE, ON or OFF
