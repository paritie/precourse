## Variables

Variables are like  containers where you can store data values. Example of values:
```
    let School = "Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida university";
```
 you write 'var' first to tell the system you want to work with variable and 'name' is the placeholder you create to hold the value 'Memunat Manzuma'.

## Strings
strings are used for storing and manipulating text.A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes. for example 
```
    var name = "Shuaibu muhammad"
```



## if statements
If statements are conditional words Used to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
```
if (3 < 5) {
    return true;
}
```
## Functions

A JavaScript function is executed when it been called.

This is called Nested If, when you have If inside If.for example:
```
function myFunc(p1, p2) {
  return p1 + p2;
}
```
