Hello dear, In this Lesson we will be learning the basics of Javascript

	* Variables - are container that hold values. They have lifetime and can change the value when asked to do so. For example in JS
    var name = "Doe";

    name is a variable 

	* Strings - are values that contain characters or combination of words enclosed within single '' or double "" qoutes. For example var name = "User";
    user is a string
	
    * Functions (arguments, `return`) - functions is organizing code into a block to perform a particular action. It help to minimize lines of code and allow easy reusability.
    for example 
    function user(name){
        //note that the function will return the name and end.
        return name;
    }

	* `if` statements -  if is used to check a condition. if you are in class lesson holds
    for example if ( 8 === 8){
        return true
    }
	
    * Boolean values (`true`, `false`) -  there are actions or decision that are based on yes or no this is same for boolean values.
     for example 
     `true` is equivalent to 1
     `false` is equivalent to 0
