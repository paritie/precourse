Concepts Explained like to a 12 year old.

Objects: Objects are like higher forms of variables, that shed or tell more details about what something or an idea can do through properties and Methods.
Properties: There are like the features or details of an object. They help us know more about an object.
Methods: They are like behaviors. They tell more about what an object can do.
For in loop: This is a method in javaScript that gives us an easy way to loop/go through all the keys in an object.
Dot Notation vs Bracket Notation: These both provide a way to access the individual properties or methods of an array. Dot notation uses a dot after
username and the particular property you want to access after the dot. Bracket notation uses the name of the object and then the particular property
inside quotes inside square brackets
