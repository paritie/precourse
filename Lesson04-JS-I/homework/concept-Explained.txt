Concepts Explained like a 12 year old.

Variables: These are like a container or a bucket that can hold things. Those things are called values.

Strings: This is a value that are like a word or a sentence in English language which can be stored in a variable. They have to be within '', "", or ``.

Functions: These are like a phone you use to make calls. To talk to person A you just call the A call function and then you can speak to person A,
likewise if you want to speak to person B, call the B call function. This is so because functions can hold a set of tasks you will likely call often.

(arguments): arguments are used with functions. they are used to pass values to functions to change the state or response of the function being called.

(return): Functions return values. just like when you call, the phone returns to you the person you called or a switched off response or an unavailable
response. And since it returns values, the value(s) can be stored in a variable.

if statements: These are used to answer Yes or No questions, like does A exist, if yes do this, or if No do not do this.

Boolean values: These are also like Yes or No but they are values. either true or false
