*DOM:
DOM is an acronym that stands for Document Object Model. It creates a model from  the HTML document when a web browser loads a page. But with the help of Javascript, we can manipulate this model. Like adding and removing elements, changing attributes of elements, and changing styling of elements. 




DOM ELEMENT SELECTORS:
There are five element selectors and they are; `document.getElementsByClassName`, `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, `document.querySelectorAll`, `document.createElement`. 




DOM EVENTS:
These are the like instructions that tell the operating system when to carry  out and event. Events are anything from a click, to a mouse entering the content area, to an image download finishing.
