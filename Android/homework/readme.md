# AwesomeDeveloper

This project will give you a chance to practice as you follow the instructions below:

### Create an Android Studio Project

1. Create a new Android Studio project
2. Name the project "AwesomeDeveloper"

### Add Buttons to the App

1. Open the app's activity_main.xml file.
2. Change the parent viewgroup to a linear layout
3. Add six buttons to the main screen
4. Each button's text attribute should be the name of a different color

### Create Listeners for Each Button

1. Create a listener and event handler for each button in MainActivity.java
2. In each event handler, change the view's background color to the color that corresponds to the button's title

>TIP: use `.setBackgroundColor(getResources().getColor(android.R.color.holo_orange_dark));` to set the background color of your component.  
>TIP: Remember to use `android.R.color.color_name` to get access to the colors provided by android. You can see which colors are available in the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.color "Android Color Documentation").

### Build, Run, and Test Your App

1. Build and run your app using the your preferred test environment.
2. Test each button to make sure that it changes the background color appropriately.
3. Remember to use logs and the debugger when you run into issues.

If everything works, congratulations! You've just built your first Android app on your own from scratch!
