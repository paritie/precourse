**Note:**You could also run `node /assignments/<fileName>` and see what prints in your terminal.

* Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork.

* [ ] Arrow Function Syntax - [Check out this awesome guide for ES6 arrow syntax](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26). You will see more and more arrow functions as you progress deeper into JavaScript. Use the [stretch-function-conversion.js](assignments/stretch-function-conversion.js) file as a helper challenge to showcase some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax.
