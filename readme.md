## Requirements to begin

Here is a git workflow for updating your fork (or downloaded copy) to the latest version:
```git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/paritie/precourse
git remote 
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/precourse

# To resolve the merge conflicts in your editor
git add . -u
git commit -m 'Updated to the latest version'
```
